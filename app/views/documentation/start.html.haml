%p <strong>2. Copy the Provide Chat Code into your website:</strong> Click on Chat Widget > Website Code. Now click in the text box that has the JavaScript code. Don't worry if you don't understand it, you will not have to edit any of this code. Next, click select all, and Copy the code (Ctrl + C).

%p To install the Provide Chat widget, paste this code (unaltered, in itâ€™s entirety) on every page of your website just before the closing </body> tag.

%p If you're not sure how to do this, or not in charge of updating the HTML on your website, you may want to forward this code to your webmaster or web developer.

%p <strong>3. Add Your Departments:</strong> If you plan to have different departments (sales, support, orders, etc), you'll want to add them here. 

%p Click on Departments -> New Department to add a new department. Next, enter in the details such as the department's name (e.g. Sales), email (e.g. sales@yourwebsite.com) and assign it to the websites to which this department belongs.

%p <strong>4. Update your Agent's Information:</strong> Now go to Agents, and for your agent click Edit.

%p Input all of the appropriate information for your agent. Input your name, display name, change your email address and password if necessary, upload a photo of yourself, and assign yourself to the website you created in Step 1.

%p You're now ready to chat live with your website visitors. You'll now want to click on the Chat Monitor to begin chatting with your site visitors. You can read documentation on how to use the chat monitor here.
